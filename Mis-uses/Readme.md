# README

This folder contains a collections 247 ML-API misuses in 360 applications used in our manual study.

We provide data in both excel and csv format.



The numbers represent number of misuses in applications, counted by code locations.

Google Vision have `batch_annotate_images` and `annotate_images` APIs for general API call. To make description clear, we use the exact function instead, e.g.`label_detection`.
