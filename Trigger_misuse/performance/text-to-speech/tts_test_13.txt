The United States accounts for about 4.25% of the world's population, but currently has about 29% of the confirmed deaths from the disease, and models used by the White House suggest the tragic toll could rise to around 147,000 by early August. Azar appeared to indicate that the inequities in the US health system, especially involving minorities, were to blame for the level of fatalities in the United States and said the administration had forged a "historic result" in preventing the pandemic from overwhelming the capacity of hospitals. "Unfortunately the American population is ... very diverse," Azar told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." "It is a population with significant unhealthy comorbidities that do make many individuals in our communities, in particular African American, minority communities particularly at risk here because of significant underlying disease health disparities and disease comorbidities -- and that is an unfortunate legacy in our health care system that we certainly do need to address." Azar insisted that he didn't mean to say that so many Americans had died because they were unhealthier than people abroad. But he added that the country had a "significantly disproportionate burden of comorbidities ... (including) obesity, hypertension, diabetes," adding that "these are demonstrated facts that do make us at risk for any type of disease burden."
