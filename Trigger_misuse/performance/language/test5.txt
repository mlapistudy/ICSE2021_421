Knowing that coronavirus transmissions often occur in clusters linked to particular settings and through certain individuals can help inform how governments, public health experts and society try to control it.
The experts all agree that frequent hand washing, masks and social distancing are key to keeping down the rate of infection. Studies back that up: A meta-analysis of more than 150 studies, recently published in The Lancet, found that the chance of transmission when people are less than about 3.3 feet apart is almost 13%, but that drops to 2.6% when they are more than 3.3 feet apart, and double that is even better. And the chance of transmission without a mask is greater than 17%, compared with 3% when a mask is worn.
Murphy adds that "massive testing -- five times more than what we have" is also needed to confirm who is sick with Covid-19 as well as to identify who may be infected and walking around without symptoms. "You have to identify them," he said. "So, basically, test everyone, and then quarantine the people who are infectious. That would do it alone."
But he points out that the barriers to getting tested (such as cost and accessibility) need to be eliminated or "people will just drop out of the system." He foresees a time not too far in the future where people can be tested and receive their result on the spot, or even test themselves at home.
Moving the focus from the action of individuals to locations, Knight says, "We may need to tailor exit strategies from lockdown to target some places more than others -- e.g. riskier settings should be kept closed or visits to these settings should be monitored in contact tracing apps. By understanding where and from who transmission occurs, we can intervene to stop it."
Osterholm adds contact tracing to the list of control measures. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which he heads, recently put out a paper on the topic, outlining the right and wrong ways to go about contact tracing without alienating people and squandering resources.
He argues for more targeted approach.
"Understanding that the whole thesis of contact tracing may just fall on this very issue [of super spreaders]," he says. "If you have a small number of cases, you can clearly try to contact trace all of them, and you're not wondering if they're super spreaders or not. With many thousands of cases, you're always going to be trying to determine: what are the highest priority? If you don't have a sense of who the super spreaders are, there's no way you can [factor] that in." But, therein lies the rub, he says: "Contact tracing won't identify these people themselves until long after they are sick." And by then, the damage will have been done.
No one knows who is super spreading -- even the person spreading the virus -- until it is too late
"If we could identify super spreaders early that would help but at this point we don't have any reasonable way to do that," said Osterholm. "There's no big double S on their forehead that says 'Super Spreader' so that we can go find them. And that's the challenge."
Murphy has a slightly different take. "If they're super spreaders or just regular spreaders, it doesn't really make any difference -- they are spreading," he said.
Ultimately, said Baeten, it comes down to all of us, because we are in this together.
"I think it's incumbent on all of us to do our best to not be a super spreader by staying away from large crowds and large attractions where we might be able to spread the virus, and by wearing a mask."
