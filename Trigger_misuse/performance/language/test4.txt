One reason someone might infect more people than others comes down to individual bodies.
"Everybody is different, they're handling the virus in their bodies differently," said Murphy. "So certain individuals, they have what we call a high viral load -- that's just the amount of virus per droplet. Some people have 10 or 100 times more virus in their droplets than other people."
Baeten agrees. "There are things we don't fully understand about this virus, but usually with viral infections, there's a range of viral loads and some people -- either because of the way the virus interacts with their immune system or their genetics -- have a higher viral load than others. And higher viral load probably means that they're more infectious to people they come around." He adds that the duration of the contact is also very important.
Both Murphy and Baeten say behavioral aspects can also play a part.
Does someone speak loudly? People who speak loudly (or sing or huff-and-puff during exercise) are thought to release more virus-laden droplets into the air because of what they are doing or how they are doing it.
Is that person an extrovert who enjoys the company of others or the huggy-feely sort who gets physically close to others? By now, we've all been schooled on the benefits of isolating and social distancing to keep infection rates down -- but even during a pandemic, that doesn't always happen.
Another factor that might lead to super spreading is timing. Studies have found that people start shedding virus particles about two days before they start showing symptoms, when they're pre-symptomatic; others never experience symptoms of Covid-19 at all -- asymptomatic -- but are still shedding virus. People in both these groups circulate throughout the day unknowingly infecting others.
"The unfortunate thing for transmitting disease is that right when the infection takes off, just before a person becomes symptomatic, they probably have the highest level [of virus]," said Murphy. "So, the day they start having symptoms, and the day before and maybe the day before that is when they have the highest viral load."
Also important is the opportunity to spread. "Just because someone has a high viral load doesn't make them a super spreader if they're behind a mask [or] at home," Baeten said. "Because the super spreading happens when someone who is able to transmit the virus is in contact with enough people that they end up spreading the virus to more people than the average."
That's where locations -- like a crowded night club, a church service or a meatpacking plant -- come into play. "Those are all the kind of events that can be a setup for having a large spread," says Baeten. "Introduce someone who's infectious -- and maybe not even super infectious -- into a crowd of people in close quarters for extended duration of time -- like a funeral, like a sporting event, like a nursing home --and that can amplify the spread."
Epidemiologists have a way of capturing that type of disease clustering across locations -- it's called the dispersion (or "K") factor.
"In a way it's a measure to give you a sense of, is this a disease that is randomly occurring over time and place, or is it one that is clustered in time and place," explains Michael Osterholm director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "If you have 100 cases, they are going to be randomly distributed much like every foot apart ... Or you can have all the same 100 cases in the same space but bunched together, so one cluster here [of] 30 people very closely together, another over there. So that's an attempt to measure is how randomly [or clustered] they occur in that space."
Another way of thinking about it is, the dispersion factor measures how many cases of infection are responsible for all the transmissions. The lower the number, the more the disease "clusters" around super spreading events or locations.
It turns out that the coronavirus clusters a lot, according to several studies. One not-yet-published study out of the University of Hong Kong found that 20% of cases in Hong Kong, all involving social gatherings, were responsible for 80% of transmissions. (That translates to a dispersion factor of about 0.45, for anyone keeping track.)
Gwenan Knight and colleagues at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine have been studying settings linked to the transmission of the coronavirus. The results of a study by her colleagues, also still a preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed, point to an even larger clustering effect.
