OF all human sciences the most useful and most imperfect appears to me to be that of mankind: and I will venture
to say, the single inscription on the Temple of Delphi contained a precept more difficult and more important than
is to be found in all the huge volumes that moralists have ever written. I consider the subject of the following
discourse as one of the most interesting questions philosophy can propose, and unhappily for us, one of the most
thorny that philosophers can have to solve. And how shall man hope to see himself as nature made him, across all the
changes which the succession of place and time must have produced in his original constitution? How can he
distinguish what is fundamental in his nature from the changes and additions which his circumstances and the
advances he has made have introduced to modify his primitive condition?
