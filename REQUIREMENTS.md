# REQUIREMENTS

This file covers aspects of hardware and software requirements for tools/checkers (located in `Tools` folder) we developed.

## Hardware environment

Processor: 2 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor

Memory: 2G RAM or higher

Disk: No requirement

Network connection: Required

In our paper, all experiments were done on the same machine, which contains a 16-core Intel Xeon E5-2667 v4 CPU (3.20GHz), 25MB L3 Cache, 64GB RAM, and 6Ã—512GB SSD (RAID 5). It has a 1000Mbps network connection, with twisted pair port. Note that all the machine-learning inference is done by cloud APIs remotely, instead of on the machine locally.
